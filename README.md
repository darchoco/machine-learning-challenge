#currently at approximately 79% accuracy. Some of the items that could help improve is understanding how the available data relates to one another. For instance, if there is data that naturally causes another set of data to trend based on changes, then that should be considered so that only one set of those data points is used so that it does not overconsider that data. For example, if you increase the power level of a stove to high, the temperature of the pan will naturally trend upwards. Only one of these datapoints should be tracked so it is not considering the same impact twice.
